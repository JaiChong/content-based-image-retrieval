This tool sorts a collection of images by filename, intensity, or color code.  It also allows for sorting by intensity and color code using relevance feedback, which is given by checking boxes between iterations.
- Contributors:
  - [PranBhardwaj](https://github.com/PranBhardwaj) implemented the Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) logic.
  - [JaiChong](https://github.com/JaiChong) implemented the GUI using Java AWT and Swing, and wrote the documentation.
  - NOTE: This project was initially collaborated on without Github, so the commit history is not an accurate reflection of the work distribution (which was roughly equal).
